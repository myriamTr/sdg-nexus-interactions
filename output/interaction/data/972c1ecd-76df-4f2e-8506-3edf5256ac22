While energy generally carries great political clout, and has virtually always been a private commodity, water resources have a long history of being considered as a public good, with access to safe water and sanitation being a human right  Decision-makers need to consider broader influences and cross-sectoral impacts, strive for innovative policies and integrated institutions. Sustainable policies should be based on sound technical, environmental and economic information addressing issues such as the availability and suitability of natural resources as well as socio-economic costs and benefits. Institutions involved in policy formulation must be mindful of the water–energy nexus and incorporate it into their planning and decision-making systems. Institutional capacity development can play an important role in fostering interdisciplinary and inter-ministerial approaches that support the integration of interdependencies in decision-making through knowledge and technology transfers between different governmental levels and sectors, and through the exchange of case-specific experiences. For major infrastructures, integrated planning and the joint design of programmes and investments between energy and water experts and managers may be appropriate.","Freshwater and energy are crucial for human wellbeing and sustainable socio-economic development. They are often at the base of major regional and global crises. Water is required to produce, transport and use all forms of energy to some degree, and energy is required for the extraction, treatment and distribution of water. The form of energy production being pursued determines the amount of water required to produce that energy. At the same time, the availability and allocation of freshwater resources determine how much (or how little) water can be secured for energy production. Decisions made for water use and management, and for energy production, can have significant, multifaceted and broad-reaching impacts on each other – and these impacts often carry a mix of both positive and negative repercussions.",,,Strong,"Currently, 768 million people lack access to an improved source of water, 2.5 billion remain without access to improved sanitation, 1.3 billion lack access to electricity and 2.6 billion use solid fuels for cooking, with its related negative health effects  Global water demand in terms of withdrawals is projected to increase by 55% towards 2050, mainly due to a growing demand from manufacturing (400%), thermal electricity generation (140%) and domestic use (130%). As a result, freshwater availability will be increasingly strained over this time period, and more than 40% of the global population is projected to be living in areas of severe water stress by 2050  Meanwhile, global energy demand is expected to grow by more than one-third over the period to 2035 (China, India, and Middle East accounting for 60%) with electricity demand growing by approximately 70% over the same time frame. This growth will be almost entirely in non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (non-OECD) countries, with India and China accounting for more than half that growth.  Approximately 90% of global power generation is water intensive, where water is used either directly through hydropower generation or indirectly in the process of thermal power generation. For instance, 80% of global electricity is produced by thermal power plants, which are responsible for major water withdrawals for cooling. According to the International Energy Agency, global water withdrawal for energy production in 2011 amounted to 583 billion m3 of which 66 billion m3 was consumed. By 2035, these figures could rise by respectively 20% and 85%, the latter being due to higher efficiency power plants and increased biofuel production – being the most water-intensive type of fuel production it may cause substantial local and regional impacts. Moreover, it is predicted that water needs for energy production will grow at twice the rate of energy demand.  Over 90% of global electricity generation is water intensive. Water is used in the extractive industries for producing fuels such as coal, uranium, oil and gas. Water is used directly for hydropower generation as well as for all forms of thermal power generation schemes that use heat to make power, which are responsible for roughly 80% of global electricity production. Water is an input for energy crops such as corn and sugar cane for ethanol and biomass for fuel pellets. Power plant cooling is responsible for 43% of total freshwater withdrawals in Europe and nearly 50% in the United States of America.  Besides consuming large quantities of water, cities also consume 60% to 80% of the commercial energy and emit about 75% of the greenhouse gases.","The WWDR 2014 calls for a coordinated approach to water and energy, based on generation and harmonization of data concerning the supply and use of energy production and water resources to inform decision-making, applying water and energy efficiency measures, and economic instruments to speed up reforms.
