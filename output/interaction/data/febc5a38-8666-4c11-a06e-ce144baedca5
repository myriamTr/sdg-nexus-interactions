Other scholars have also found similar correlation in neoliberal agenda pushing a number of people into poverty (Amann and Baer 2002).  In Argentina for instance, the unemployment rate increased from 6.5 % to over 17 %, while at the same time, the number of poor people soared from 22 to 27 % between 1991 and 1995 due to the implementation of neoliberal-oriented monetary policies of the World Bank and IMF in line with attainment of sustainable development goals of the country",,undermining SDG 1 further affects SDG 15,"main objective of this paper is to critically analyse the relationship between neoliberal economic agenda and sustainable development.

In Ghana, removal of subsidies discouraged the use of agricultural inputs such as insecticides and ammonium sulphate, therefore people expanded land area cultivation to increase yield. In effect, the neoliberal practices and the pressure to survive competition can often push poor farmers and other people to adopt unsustainable natural resource management practices. There is also growing body of research highlighting that the overwhelming consumption patterns of nonpoor groups (especially high income groups) and the production and distribution systems driven by neoliberalism and its associated globalisation are contributing marginally to environmental degradation.  The liberalisation of trade under the neoliberal regime has increased incentives for the production of cash crops, timber logging and mineral extraction. In one study on deforestation and biodiversity in Ghana, Benhin and Barbier (2004) found that liberalisation has created an increase in returns on timber logging and therefore provides an incentive for destructive logging. Also, in an effort to promoting export opportunities and free trade, the expansion of banana production has been found to have led to deforestation and excessive use of chemical fertilisers in Costa Rica, while timber production has caused deforestation and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources in Tanzania and Chile",,,"main objective of this paper is to critically analyse the relationship between neoliberal economic agenda and sustainable development.

However, while industrial aquaculture is deemed to be polluting, unsustainable, and a source of social conflicts, on the other hand, traditional aquaculture has very often been considered a key livelihood activity for small and poor communities. The link between shrimp farming and mangrove deforestation is one example where inappropriate farming practices have led to habitat loss and pollution, as have some circumstances associated with intensive net‐cage fish farming causing localized inshore eutrophication (Soto et al., 2012). In addition, rearing fish with compound feeds containing high levels of fish meal/fish oil derived from small wild pelagic fish is also considered unsustainable in the long term. Considerable progress has been made in recent years to reduce the levels of fishery‐ derived feedstuffs in the feeds used for farming fish and shrimp. There is also the issue of escapees from fish farms, which may affect marine biodiversity through genetic dilution of native wild stocks. In general, public criticism and negative perceptions of the environmental impacts are impediments to the creation of new aquaculture activities - reinforced by a number of public campaigns focusing on negative impacts of some aquaculture systems. However, much progress has been made globally to develop and disseminate good (and ‘best’) aquaculture practices. Moreover, non‐finfish aquaculture represents a large proportion of the world's seafood production and can contribute positively to ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and nitrogen utilization. Additionally, most marine aquaculture operations are located in coastal areas and have a strong overlap with conservation interests as both MPAs and aquaculture are highly dependent on good water quality. Therefore, based on the intertwined relationship between aquaculture, the environment and MPAs, the potential exists for aquaculture farms to serve as early warning systems for the ecological status of coastal ecosystems. Thus, with appropriate site selection and management, for example through the establishment of allocated zones for aquaculture ‘AZA’, aquaculture interests could be directly aligned with MPA objectives.",,,Strong,"Around 85% of the world0s fisheries are either being fished at full capacity or already overexploited, and depleted.

More than 70% of the mortality occurs in Asia, and more than 50% in China and India (together 2.2 million per year). Per capita mortality is highest in Eastern Europe with 1.6 persons per 1000 inhabitants per year, being more than twice that in India and four times compared to North America.. The steepest recent increase in air pollution related mortality occurs in South Asia, especially India. Globally about 18% (up to 780 000 deaths per year) cannot be easily managed, and are thus difficult to avoid, being attributable to natural PM2.5, mostly aeolian desert dust. In Germany, for example, 24 000 deaths per year may be prevented by banning NH3 emissions from agriculture while, for comparison, it is 11 000 deaths per year for road traffic emissions (this is 3.5 times the annual number of fatalities by traffic accidents in Germany).  Globally, more than 50% of the population lives in the urban environment, typically associated with degraded and poor air quality.  Nearly 90% of humanity lives in areas where the WHO air quality guideline of 10 mg m3 annual average PM2.5 is exceeded (PM2.5 is fine particulate mass with a diameter less than 2.5 µm). It has been estimated that worldwide about 3.3 million deaths were attributable to PM2.5 and ozone pollution in the year 2010.  In terms of the value of lives lost and ill health, air pollution is costing OECD societies plus China and India an estimated 3.5 trillion US dollars per year, with a rising trend.

Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) offer the advantage of responding relatively rapidly to control measures, which is particularly helpful if climate change needs to be averted in the near term.

More than 70% of the mortality occurs in Asia, and more than 50% in China and India (together 2.2 million per year). Per capita mortality is highest in Eastern Europe with 1.6 persons per 1000 inhabitants per year, being more than twice that in India and four times compared to North America.. The steepest recent increase in air pollution related mortality occurs in South Asia, especially India. Globally about 18% (up to 780 000 deaths per year) cannot be easily managed, and are thus difficult to avoid, being attributable to natural PM2.5, mostly aeolian desert dust. In Germany, for example, 24 000 deaths per year may be prevented by banning NH3 emissions from agriculture while, for comparison, it is 11 000 deaths per year for road traffic emissions (this is 3.5 times the annual number of fatalities by traffic accidents in Germany).  Globally, more than 50% of the population lives in the urban environment, typically associated with degraded and poor air quality.  Nearly 90% of humanity lives in areas where the WHO air quality guideline of 10 mg m3 annual average PM2.5 is exceeded (PM2.5 is fine particulate mass with a diameter less than 2.5 µm). It has been estimated that worldwide about 3.3 million deaths were attributable to PM2.5 and ozone pollution in the year 2010.  In terms of the value of lives lost and ill health, air pollution is costing OECD societies plus China and India an estimated 3.5 trillion US dollars per year, with a rising trend.  WHO estimates that the number of people who die annually from malaria and HIV/AIDS together is about 1.5–1.6 million, which is roughly one third compared to air pollution","A chemistry climate model was applied to study the reduction of mortality due to air pollution emission controls in the last decades, focussing on the USA and Western Europe and it was found that more than 520 000 mortalities have been mitigated owing to extensive reduction in sulphate aerosol and improvements in O3 and NO2 pollution. This shows that air pollution controls in the USA and EU have actually achieved considerable public health benefits, even though additional efforts will be essential to come down from the high numbers.  Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) offer the advantage of responding relatively rapidly to control measures, which is particularly helpful if climate change needs to be averted in the near term. Considering that SLCPs also affect public health and ecosystems, policies on air quality and climate intersect, and it is useful to consider win-win strategies. On the other hand, air pollution controls are often achieved through technology improvements, which typically also improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.",,,693
