In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, women and girls cumulatively spend 40 billion hours a year (up to six hours every day) collecting water, which deprives them of time for earning money, learning new skills, getting an education and participating in public life.3 Safe and convenient access to water and sanitation facilities also increases privacy and reduces risk to women and girls of sexual harassment/assault while gathering water. Recent data shows that, in 2011, only 45 percent of schools in least developed and low-income countries had adequate sanitation facilities.4 The lack of such facilities often keeps girls out of school, which has a long-term impact on their future prospects.",(UNDP supports) the participation of women in the development and implementation of water resource strategies and service delivery policies to ensure that water resources are well managed and that service delivery takes into account the needs of both women and men. (UNDP supports) the strengthening of the participation of local communities and rural women in water and sanitation management and in monitoring the quality of related services.,,,"5, 8"
