However, despite long-running government extension programmes and projects funded by the World Bank and other donors, low agricultural productivity and high levels of food insecurity in rural areas restrict the surplus available to supply the urban population. About 70 % of the mainland population of Tanzania is still rural, with the majority engaged in subsistence farming for their own or very local consumption.","Rural food production in Tanzania is also increasingly impaired by a growing demand for energy, feed and construction wood (Mnenwa and Maliti 2010), a changing economic system with consequences for trade flows and patterns, and governance factors (Riisgaard et al. 2010; von Braun 2007). These problems are being addressed by the Government under the Kilima Kwanza (‘Agriculture First’) policy, through potentially transformative projects, such as the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) project,7 which aims over 20 years to bring 350,000 ha of farmland into commercial production for national, regional and international markets.  Village cases show that the rural supply potential is constrained by large regional differences in yields in smallscale farming in Tanzania and by farmers’ own food security needs. The differences in yields are mostly explained by limited rainfall (which limits the use of improved seeds), but also by pests and diseases, poor knowledge of farmers and lack of appropriate support",,,,Strong,Table 4 p. 980,,,Paper's focus is on urban food security in Tanzania,979

In addition, the concern that more bioenergy (for BECarbon capture and storage) necessarily leads to unacceptably high food prices is not founded on large agreement in the literature. AR5, for example, finds a significantly lower effect of large-scale bioenergy deployment on food prices by mid-century than the effect of climate change on crop yields. Also, Muratori et al. (2016) show that BECarbon capture and storage reduces the upward pressure on food crop prices by lowering carbon prices and lowering the total biomass demand in climate change mitigation scenarios. On the other hand, competition for land use may increase food prices and thereby increase risk of hunger.
