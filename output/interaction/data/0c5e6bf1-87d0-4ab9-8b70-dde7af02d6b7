Faced with education challenges, the public wants to know who is responsible and policy-makers look for urgent solutions. Increased accountability often tops the list. When systems fail, people call for someone to be held responsible and for mechanisms to be in place that ensure corrective action (...) But reaching SDG 4 is often a collective enterprise (...) Accountability, therefore, does not easily rest with single actors (...) But accountability [for education] starts with governments. They are ultimately the primary duty bearers of the right to education.",,"Why accountability matters (…): Children cannot read after several years of school in sub-Saharan Africa; examination pressure is having an impact on gender gaps in China; the excess focus in education on employability is being questioned in Germany; decentralization is posing challenges for underfunded rural schools in Pakistan; low-quality private universities are proliferating in Paraguay; refugee children have severely constrained education chances, especially those fleeing war in the Syrian Arab Republic.",,,,"A credible education plan is the basis for accountability. It should have clear targets and lines of responsibility and allocate resources through transparent budgets that can be tracked and queried. Policy processes must be open to broad and meaningful consultation. In Brazil, about 3.5 million people participated in the national education plan consultation. Transparency of information is vital to make accountability work. Around half of countries have produced a national education monitoring report analysing progress related to their national education plan and budget since 2010, although only one in six have done so annually. Independent checks and balances help hold governments to account. The ombudsman offices in Latin America from 1982 to 2011 helped increase access to education, despite the lack of sanctioning power. In the Philippines, volunteers monitored up to 85% of 7,000 textbook delivery points helping reduce costs by twothirds and procurement time by half. Legal and regulatory routes to accountability are the backbone of a well-functioning state. In Kenya, the Education Board closed down private schools not meeting standards. But standards need to be set at a level compatible with the available human or material resources so that countries do not overburden themselves with regulations that are ignored in practice."," FIGURE 10.1:  Early childhood education participation has increased rapidly in many countries Participation rate in organized learning one year before official primary entry age, selected countries, 2000–2015..

Generally speaking, poverty can be reduced through higher average growth, a narrowing in inequality, or a combination of the two",policy interventions that reduce extreme poverty may or may not be effective in boosting shared prosperity if the two groups—the poor and the bottom 40— are composed of distinct populations. Efforts to foster growth need to be complemented by equity- enhancing policies and interventions.,"A trade-off between efficiency and equity is not inevitable. The evidence that equityenhancing interventions can also bolster economic growth and long-term prosperity is wide-ranging. To the extent that such interventions interrupt the intergenerational reproduction of inequalities of opportunity, they address the roots and drivers of inequality, while laying the foundations for boosting shared prosperity and fostering long-term growth. Reducing inequalities of opportunity among individuals, economies, and regions may also be conducive to political and societal stability and social cohesion.
