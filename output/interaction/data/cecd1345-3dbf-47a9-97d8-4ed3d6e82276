A reasonable yet ambitious course of action would be for improved pastures to increase from 15.4% to 30% of total grazing area devoted to beef production by 2030 which could reduce 5% of Uruguay’s emissions from enteric fermentation and sequester carbon equivalent to 100kg CO2/ha/yr (or 0.3kg CO2/kg LW/yr) more than natural grasslands.  Improved feeding will accelerate animal growth rate, thus increasing the efficiency of the reproductive cycle but also impacting the environmental footprint.  Based on a sample of 15 beef production cycles representing a range of intensification across Uruguay, it was found that for every 10kg increase in productivity per hectare, carbon footprint decreases by 1.2kg CO2e/kg LW and 36kg CO2e/ha.If 50% of grazing land devoted to beef production were to use nitrification inhibitors, the carbon footprint could be reduced by 0.3kg CO2e/kg LW or 40kg CO2e/ha.  Assuming 600–650 trees per ha, sequestering 0.9t C/ha, trees for livestock shading are already helping to avoid emissions of 0.26 million tons CO2e per year.

The next steps for the Uruguay team are to develop similar pathways for the other major agricultural sub-sectors. However, it should be noted that the Uruguayan case is unique which makes it a challenge to replicate in other countries: inparticular, the combination of economic and environmental incentives that make sustainable development objectives a top government priority, and a tight-knit group of well-coordinated stakeholders that facilitate the translation of science to policy.",,,,Strong,"The beef sector is a critical component of Uruguay’s agricultural sector, responsible for approximately half of Uruguay’s agricultural GDP, which is 8–9% of overall GDP. Moreover, for a country of just 3.4 million people , it supplies 5% of the beef on the global market (in terms of weight), making up 20% of the total value of Uruguay’s exports ($1.5billion). In addition to its economic importance, Uruguay’s beef sector has a significant environmental footprint. The land devoted to beef production covers over two thirds of Uruguay’s surface area, even though it has been displaced from some of Uruguay’s most productive soils in recent years by crop production.   The current N footprint is approximately 66kg N lost/kgLW/yr and 7.3kg N lost/ha/yr. The 2030 targets for each of these metrics are 48kg N lost/kgLW/yr and 6.3kg N lost/ha/yr respectively. Achieving these targets would reduce N losses of approximately 26,500t N/yr, equivalent to 30% of current N losses from Uruguay’s beef sector. The two strategies used to achieve these targets are N inhibitors (both nitrification and urease inhibitors) and improved pastures.",,,"This paper aims to present a practical approach for countries to build national roadmaps based on concrete courses of action that could transform their agricultural sector in line with the SDGs.
