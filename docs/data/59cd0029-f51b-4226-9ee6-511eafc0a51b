PSIDS need therefore to pay careful attention to the balance between the volume and type of tourist activity, and the sensitivities and carrying capacities of their natural environments to ensure the tourism sector remains sustainable. Tourism and associated services must also be arranged in ways that assure the widest possible economic benefits in terms of job creation, revenues and investment.","Revenue from tourism can also be volatile however, and subject to considerable revenue leakages. Tourism is highly sensitive to economic conditions in major developed economies and visitors can also be deterred by extreme weather events, political instability or other shocks. Tourism numbers can therefore impact a country’s ability to collect revenues from targeted tourism taxes. Additionally, the tourism sector relies heavily on imports of building materials, machinery, transport equipment and consumption goods. As a consequence, a significant share of the income generated by the sector also flows out in the form of payments for those imported goods and services. This is exacerbated by tax incentives provided by some countries to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) in the tourism sector and profit repatriation which also lower revenues generated by the sector.","Other case: Fiji’s Green Growth Framework was introduced in 2014 and establishes a benchmark for every development decision made by the Government. The framework is a tool to accelerate integrated and inclusive sustainable development in Fiji and is underpinned by a series of principles. Within the tourism sector, the Government introduced an environmental levy in 2016, charged on visitors for certain services, the proceeds of which are to support environmental programmes. In the 2016-2017 financial year, the levy is expected to mobilize almost FJD$ 9 million (US$ 4.3 million)",57
