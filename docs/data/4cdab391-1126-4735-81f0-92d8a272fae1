For example, clearing of forest for conventional agriculture has increased the provision of food and feed (NCP 12) and other materials important for people (such as natural fibres, timber and ornamental flowers: NCP 13) but has reduced contributions as diverse as pollination (NCP 2), climate regulation (NCP 4), water quality regulation (NCP 7), opportunities for learning and inspiration (NCP 15) and the maintenance of options for the future (NCP 18).",,,,,,,,,,8
