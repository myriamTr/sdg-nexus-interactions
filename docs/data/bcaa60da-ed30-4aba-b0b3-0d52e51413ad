More than 75 per cent of the total terrestrial biomass carbon stock and more than 40 per cent of the soil organic carbon stock are found in forest ecosystems (Jandl et al. 2007). In the 1990s, forest carbon sequestration was equivalent to approximately one-third of carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land-use change (Bonan 2008). Boreal forests store more carbon in their soils than tropical forests, while tropical forests store much more carbon in their plant biomass (Prentice et al. 2001). Pan et al.

Fires are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions from forests (van der Werf et al. 2010). Boreal forest ecosystems are prone to frequent and severe wildfires leading to large carbon emissions.

(2001) estimated that during the period 1949–1999, on average 2 million hectares of the Canadian boreal forest burnt annually (ranging from 0.3 to 7.5 million hectares in any given year), emitting a yearly average of 27±6 million tonnes of carbon (ranging from 3 to 115 million tonnes in any given year). Sukhinin et al.

Gillett et al. (2004) found that recent increases in area burnt in Canada are a result of anthropogenic climate change.
