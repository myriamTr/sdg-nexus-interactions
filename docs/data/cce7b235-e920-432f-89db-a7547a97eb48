are playing a growing role in the region’s scientific
integration, as the continent prepares the groundwork
for its own African Economic Community by 2028. Both
the Economic Community of West African States and the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) have
adopted regional strategies for STI in recent years that complement the continent’s decadal plans.1 The East African
Community (EAC) has entrusted the Inter-University Council
for East Africa with the mission of developing a Common
Higher Education Area. The ongoing development of
networks of centres of excellence across the continent should
foster greater scientific mobility and information-sharing, as
long as obstacles to the mobility of scientists can be removed.
