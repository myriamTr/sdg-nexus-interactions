For example, the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has been regularly infecting individual humans in Central and Eastern Africa for hundreds of years without establishing itself as the transmissible human disease we now know as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Sustained human-to-human transmission only occurred in the second half of the twentieth century, but such emergence from the zoonotic reservoir has now occurred at least three times, resulting in as many distinct lineages of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) today (Sharp and Hahn 2011).

Increased competition for land resources will increase social and political instability, exacerbating food insecurity, poverty, conflict and migration. It is critical that land degradation is effectively addressed. Management of land degradation will have co-benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity conservation, in addition to enhancing food security and sustainable livelihoods. The concept of land degradation neutrality (LDN) was introduced into the global dialogue to stimulate a more effective policy response to land degradation. LDN is defined as “a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain stable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems”. LDN will underpin the achievement of multiple SDGs related to food security, environmental protection and the sustainable use of natural resources.

The Future Earth Health  Knowledge Action Network responds to this call, bringing health researchers together with other natural and social scientists, health and environmental policy experts and leaders in government, the private sector and civil society. The goal is to promote research-based solutions for better, integrated understanding of the complex interactions between a changing global environment (such as climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, fishery declines and land use change), the loss of ecosystem services and the health of human beings (including livelihoods, nutrition and well-being). Long-term integrated observation systems to collect rigorous health, socio-economic and environmental data will be encouraged. Another major focus will be to build regional capacity to integrate and act on planetary health knowledge to enhance resilience, protect the environment and avert serious threats to health.",,,3
