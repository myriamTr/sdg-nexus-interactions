This, according to the IEA, is a positive development for the climate change community, as it suggests that efforts to mitigate climate change may be having a more pronounced effect on emissions than has previously been thought. The IEA attributed the observed stagnation in CO2 emissions to changing patterns of energy consumption in key emitting countries, mainly China and OECD countries. In China, for instance, there was increased use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower, coupled with a decline in the use of coal to generate electricity. Other countries made significant progress recently on efforts to promote a more sustainable growth by implementing energy efficiency plans and increasing the amount of renewable energy in their energy mix (IEA, 2014).
