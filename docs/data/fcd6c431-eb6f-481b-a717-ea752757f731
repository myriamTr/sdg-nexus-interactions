It sees violent conflict as inherent in the development enterprise itself, arising out of the accumulation strategies pursued by political and economic elites, together with their corporate allies and international backers. It entertains the possibility that violence can be harnessed to the creation as well as the destruction of wealth. It draws upon a somewhat different pool of research findings, including detailed ethnographies and historical studies, rather than the large-n cross-national statistical studies, which tend to be favoured by the mainstream. It harks back to earlier traditions of analysis on structural violence by focusing on inequality, state violence and globalisation as major determinants of conflict. And it focuses less upon state fragility than upon the state itself, notably when its security policies are repressive; its development programmes are top-down and extractive; and its structures are unresponsive to the needs of citizens, especially the poor and marginalised.","need for a long term historical perspective on how varying trajectories of development and of underdevelopment generate violence; which understands how different pathways to and from violence in turn reshape the pattern of development, or usher in new cycles of underdevelopment. It suggests that policy should concentrate less upon security and violence-reduction as ends in themselves; and more upon tackling the inequalities in wealth and power that lie at the root of insecurity and violence. It recognises the pitfalls of relying upon compromised national elites or international actors to build peace, when they shoulder much of the responsibility for violence. And it emphasises the struggles and agency of those most exposed to poverty and violence, both in putting pressure on decision-makers to respond to their concerns and in creating alternatives to violence in their own right.",,,,Strong,,,,"There is the shared worldview that liberal peace and the curbing of violence are essential preconditions for sustainable development. The paper investigates behind this consensus to spell out the multiple ways violence presents itself and affects security and peace-building, and goes on to argue that violence is intimately connected to how states construct security and pursue development. Building durable and inclusive peace requires a different view of security, which is rooted in the experience and vernacular understandings of the people and groups who are ‘secured’.  The thrust of the analysis above is that the forms of violence are multiple and their laws of motion complex. For this reason, turning SDG 16s goal of reducing violence into practical peacebuilding poses immense problems. The starting point should be the vernacular understandings of those most affected by violent conflict. They are by no means passive cyphers in the dramas of violence war, peace and security. Only by listening to them can the grip of dominant state and security-centred paradigms over analysis and policy be broken.",108

Attempts to regulate livestock densities and nutrient flows (e.g. setting upper limit of livestock per available land unit or liquid manure markets) did not lead to satisfactory improvement. Over the past decade, one can even note a reversion of the promising trend of the early 2000s. In addition to a continuing intensification of livestock production, the situation has been considerably aggravated by the increasing cultivation of energy plants, in particular maize. National subsidies supporting electricity production from renewables promoted a steep increase in biogas production. Implications are increased groundwater pollution due to fertilization and deposition of digestate and a skyrocketing of prices for agricultural land. The latter has generated in particular pressure on smaller farmers who are not only affected by processes of concentration and consolidation but also start to be replaced by large investment companies. The number of agricultural businesses decreased between 2003 and 2014 by about 50% whereas the cultivated area remained constant. The persistent nitrate problem violating EU legislation has led to an initiation of treaty violation proceedings by the European Commission against Germany. The German tax payer thus faces the threat to have to cover a fine of several billions Euros.",Already existing problems have been aggravated by a lack of policy integration.,"Intensive livestock and biogas production have a negative effect on drinking water supply. Biogas production competes with food production for agricultural land. At the same time biogas production affects the intensification of livestock production in large farms positively by increasing the price for land, which favours intensive production forms over ecological farming and family business. There the arrow from biogas to intensive livestock production has both a negative (direct competition for agricultural land) and positive (increasing land prices make intensive livestock production more profitable than other livestock production methods) sign. Overall, both biogas and intensive livestock production affect ecosystem functions (e.g. habitat diversity) negatively. Drinking water supply effects ecosystem functions positively if it or as it often contributes towards the provision of regulating services related to groundwater recharge.",,,Strong,,"The problem constellation as encountered in the German case study is quite typical for many regions in the world.
