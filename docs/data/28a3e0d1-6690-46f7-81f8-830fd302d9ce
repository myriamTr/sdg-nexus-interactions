However, rural smallholder food production is already constrained by the pressure of population on land and other resources, while subsistence requirements, inadequate support services and poor market access limit their market participation.","To overcome these challenges, Tanzanian policy is already shifting from the goal of supplying urban populations with food at favourable prices to a more rural focus with the aim of improving the capacity of rural areas to meet growing urban demand.  Kilimo Kwanza: is a national strategy of the Government which includes increasing crop production, improving livestock husbandry and undertaking fish farming.   'The goal of supplying the urban population with food at favourable prices was frequently pursued both with agricultural and trade policy, and with income policy and selective support measures' despite empirical evidence that 'poverty and food insecurity are to be found primarily in rural areas of Africa' (Geier 1995, p.167). Twenty years later, the Tanzanian Government still struggles to balance the competing objectives of ensuring adequate prices to producers while maintaining low prices for consumers (Temu et al. 2010; Haug and Hella 2013).",,,,Strong,"Urban population growth and projections for Tanzania see Tables 1 and 2 (p. 975)  The Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperatives highlights that food security in urban areas is mainly threatened by increasing food prices and higher price fluctuations compared to rural areas (URT 2006). This is also underlined by theWorld Food Programme, where main causes of urban food shortages in Tanzania are attributed to Bno money^ (35 %), Bdrought^ (15 %) and Bexpensive food^ (18 %) (WFP 2013).
