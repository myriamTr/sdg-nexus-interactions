Managing urban green space sustainably requires cities to consider the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and make trade-offs between benefits and risks. IS could support these choices by consolidating diverse information (e.g. tree cleansing capacities, the costs of not maintaining trees and the perceived value and benefits of recreational offerings) and making it available for systematic green space planning, management and maintenance (pruning, watering, pest monitoring and control and ensuring overall plant health). Traditionally, management of green spaces has been carried out by city managers who regularly contract out certain activities, such as routine maintenance. However, cities are beginning to contract out more complex responsibilities such as financing, policy, strategy, planning, development, stakeholder involvement and/or management. Also, there is a move toward a co-governance approach in which citizens participate in policy setting and maintenance activities. Such trends are creating new demands for city managers and raising concerns with respect to the representativeness and transparency actually realized within more participative management processes. Herein lies another opportunity for IS to enhance sustainable green space management.",,,,,Strong,,"In order to achieve the SDGs by 2030, major transformations will be needed at all levels, including in the IS used by cities. Based on findings, the suggestion is that progress may be constrained by IS that do not support cities across the three spheres of engagement. Further, a new type of IS, an IIE, may be needed which serves to address challenges and coordinate activities. The IIE is defined as an adaptive collection of independent, yet interrelated and integrated information technologies and systems whose interactions holistically support activities in the administrative, political and sustainability spheres, thereby enabling the development of smart sustainable cities. Within the IIE, existing and emergent technologies, such the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, mobile technologies, open data, augmented reality and big data analytics, among others, will support cities’ data collection, permit deep analysis and enable broad communication and collaboration across spheres, may be what cities require in order to make more rapid progress toward achievement of the SDGs. For the IIE see also Figure 7 on page 446. In order to build smart sustainable cities, effective and purposeful interactions must occur between the administrative, political and sustainability spheres.
