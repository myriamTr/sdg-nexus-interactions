Examples include sustainable urban development (among other reduction of air pollution), climate change (reduction of CO2 emissions), development of marine and terrestrial biodiversity (among others via reduced climate change), eradication of poverty and hunger and decent work and economic growth (via provisioning of energy services), and good health and wellbeing (provisioning of energy services and reduction of air pollution).
