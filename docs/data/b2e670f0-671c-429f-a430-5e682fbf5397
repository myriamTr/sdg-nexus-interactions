Benefits and burdens associated with nature’s contributions are distributed and experienced differently among social groups, countries and regions. Because optimizing for certain benefits impedes the production of others, many ecological changes benefit some people at the expense of others, just as changes in technological and institutional arrangements enable access by some actors at the expense of others. For example, although food production today is sufficient to satisfy global needs, approximately 11 per cent of the world’s population is undernourished. The great expansion in the production of food, fibre and bioenergy has occurred at the cost of many other contributions to human quality of life.",,,,,,,,,,3
