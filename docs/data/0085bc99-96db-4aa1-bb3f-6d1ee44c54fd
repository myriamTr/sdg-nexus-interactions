To reach this high rate, researchers should try to find a global solution for energy system optimization instead of local answers. One of the potential category of energy customer, consuming more than 21% of whole energy over the world, are residential users; hence, improving their consumption patterns will increase energy efficiency substantially. By raising the use of micro combined heat and power (CHP) systems in a near future for household applications, synergy effects of coupling between electricity and natural gas networks draw researchers’ attention to propose an integrated picture of these two physically separated networks: Coupling different energy carriers is recognized as Energy Hub (EH).",,"Within the hub, energy is converted, stored, and conditioned using CHP technology, transformers, power-electronic devices, compressors, heat exchangers,storage systems, and other equipment. e.g. Electricity and natural gas are provided at the input port of the hub and a gastank, an electrical transformer, a gas turbine, a furnace, a battery,and heat storage are inside it. By using energy storages and converters, the energy consumer can manage their demand dynamically.  Programming the proposed dynamic load management in the real world has two main shortcomings: 1) almost all approaches applied to optimize the energy consumption of residential customers require defining some specific parameters, e.g., appliances efficiencies and energy prices, as constant, however, such an assumption would not necessary hold accurate in practice. 2) The conventional smart grid architecture has several problems: first, the master-slave architecture causes extensive exposure to cyber-attacks such as the distributed denial of service, attacks from the compromised nodes in the demand response model. Second, one of the main concerns in the existing approaches is single failure in master-slave architecture. Third, demand response is performed in a utility energy management systems. Because of limited memory and storage capacity, increasing the number of customers will be a crucial issue for energy management. Finally,using sensor nodes and intelligent devices, an early warning system can be integrated with the grid, however, due to limited energy and bandwidth resources, real-time implementation is quite difficult.",,,Medium,"The results confirm the increment of energy system efficiency and demonstrate that when the proposed demand response program is applied, the total energy cost and electrical peak load are reduced up to 30% and 50%, respectively.","To address shortcomings of conventional smart grid architecture, a model for utilizing the cloud computing technology is proposed, a next generation computing paradigm in the smart grid domain. Cloud computing refers to manipulate, configure, and access the applications online, and offers online data storage, infrastructure, and application. Cloud computing is probably the simplest and best fitted way for smart grids due to its scalable and flexible characteristics, and its capability to manage large amounts of data.The utility company and customers interact through the cloud, and the functions for realizing demand response are performed in a cloud rather than in the utility EMS.  Concerns are also addressed by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, one of the machine intelligence techniques, to solve real-world problem with a dynamice environment; RL is the study of programs that improve their performance and adapt an agent to an unknown and dynamic environment by receiving rewards and punishments from the environment.  To model separate energy infrastructures in one framework, Smart Energy Hub(SEH) is used. SEH models Smart Grid and Cloud Computing in multi-carrier energy systems. SEH solutions allow hubs to monitor and control energy usages in real time and therefore manage their energy consumption to reduce their energy bills.",,"This paper introduces Smart Energy Hub as a new framework and proposes Reinforcement Learning algorithm as a practical method to find optimal electricity and natural gas consumptions of this system in stochastic environment for a residential customer.To facilitate the information management among households and utility companies, we propose a new configuration based on cloud computing system. In this model, any household communicates its load profiles to the CC to reach an optimal DR based on the RL approach.",42

Most trade-offs characterized here are associated with marine protection (SDG 14.5), which – despite increasing evidence for positive ecological outcomes – has been linked with displacement of coastal communities and conflicting visions of marine management objectives.

Two of the Oceans targets (ending overfishing – SDG 14.4 – and increasing economic benefits to SIDS – SDG 14.7) are associated with a disproportionate number of targets and perhaps should be given global priority among all Oceans targets.

Trends show that GDP per capita and forest growth both characteristically increase in value with time. Global GDP per capita gradually increases due to inflation from industrialization, removing tariffs and national stability. In addition, without conditions that cause decreases in forest stock, such as forest degradation and forest management, forest stock should also increase due to forest restoration activities. Therefore, increasing trends from 1950–2000 are reasonable in many countries even in the context of fluctuation between countries. Inversed patterns between forest growth and economic changes in several countries suggest that environmental sustainability can be different depending on land status. From the perspective of the forest transition model (FT), a decrease in forest stock is the result of deforestation and forest degradation in the early and late transition stage of forest land changes, but forest stability is a constant stage observed in the restored area.

In addition, forest area changes compared with GDP and GDP per capita changes were analyzed to identify LDPs.
