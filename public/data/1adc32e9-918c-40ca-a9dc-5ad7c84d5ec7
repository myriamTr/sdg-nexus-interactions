As water is used to convert energy into useful forms, energy efficiency is anticipated to reduce water consumption and waste water, resulting in more clean water for other sectors and the environment. Subsidies for renewables are anticipated to lead to the benefits and trade-offs outlined when deploying renewables. Subsidies for renewables could lead to improved water access and treatment if subsidies support projects that provide both water and energy services (e.g., solar desalination).",Mitigation options in Buildings,,,,,,,,"Bilton et al., 2011; Scott, 2011; Kumar et al., 2012; Meldrum et al., 2013; Bartos and Chester, 2014; Hendrickson and Horvath, 2014; Kern et al., 2014; Holland et al., 2015; Fricko et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017",496

However, in some situations the switch to a low-carbon fuel such as, for example, biofuel could increase water use compared to existing conditions if the biofuel comes from a water-intensive feedstock. Improved access to energy can support clean water and sanitation technologies. If energy access is supported with waterintensive energy sources, there could be trade-offs with water efficiency targets.",Mitigation options in Buildings,,,,,,,,"Hejazi et al., 2015; Cibin et al., 2016; Fricko et al., 2016; Song et al., 2016; Rao and Pachauri, 2017",497
