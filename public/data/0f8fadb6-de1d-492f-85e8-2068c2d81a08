The long-term storage of nuclear waste is a politically fraught subject, with no large-scale long-term storage operational worldwide. Negative impacts from upstream uranium mining and milling are comparable to those of coal, hence replacing fossil fuel combustion by nuclear power would be neutral in that aspect. Increased occurrence of childhood leukaemia in populations living within 5 km of nuclear power plants was identified by some studies, even though a direct causal relation to ionizing radiation could not be established and other studies could not confirm any correlation (low evidence/agreement on this issue).",Mitigation options in Replacing Coal,,,,,,,,"Abdelouas, 2006; Cardis et al., 2006; Kaatsch et al., 2008; Al-Zoughool and Krewski, 2009; Heinävaara et al., 2010; Schnelzer et al., 2010; Brugge and Buchner, 2011; Møller and Mousseau, 2011; Møller et al., 2011, 2012; Moomaw et al., 2011; UNSCEAR, 2011; Sermage-Faure et al., 2012; Ten Hoeve and Jacobson, 2012; Tirmarche et al., 2012; Hiyama et al., 2013; Mousseau and Møller, 2013; Smith et al., 2013; WHO, 2013; IPCC, 2014; von Stechow et al., 2016",485
