Meanwhile, however, indicators of contributions associated with ecosystem regulation, such as soil organic carbon or pollinator diversity, have declined, suggesting that such gains are not sustainable, with important implications. For example, land degradation has reduced agricultural productivity in 23 per cent of the global terrestrial area and between US$235 billion and US$577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk as a result of pollinator loss.",,,,,,,,,,3

In addition, the concern that more bioenergy (for BECarbon capture and storage) necessarily leads to unacceptably high food prices is not founded on large agreement in the literature. AR5, for example, finds a significantly lower effect of large-scale bioenergy deployment on food prices by mid-century than the effect of climate change on crop yields. Also, Muratori et al. (2016) show that BECarbon capture and storage reduces the upward pressure on food crop prices by lowering carbon prices and lowering the total biomass demand in climate change mitigation scenarios. On the other hand, competition for land use may increase food prices and thereby increase risk of hunger. Use of agricultural residue for bioenergy can reduce soil carbon, thereby threatening agricultural productivity.",Mitigation options in Replacing Coal,,,,,,,,"See literature on increased biomass use: IPCC, 2014; Muratori et al., 2016; Dooley and Kartha, 2018",485
