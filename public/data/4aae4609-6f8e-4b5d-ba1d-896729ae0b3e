A prominent example is the “Food-Water-Energy Nexus” [29,33–36] The basic idea behind this concept is that significant amounts of energy are needed to access water as well as produce food, while significant amounts of water are needed to produce energy and food. In particular, water shortages are beginning to threaten not only food but also energy production and energy security. In the future, more and more energy may be needed to provide water if desalination becomes more widely used. ",,"Likewise, energy production produces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and various types of air and water pollution that undermine health and worsen poverty.",,,Strong,,"Therefore, energy, water, and food need to be managed in a more integrated way, also taking into consideration a range of related factors such as land availability, soil health, and impacts on biodiversity [33–36]. Understanding these linkages requires analytical capability, and managing them well requires sufficient capacity for cross-sectoral planning, implementation, and monitoring. Le Blanc [29] observes that nexus studies have found a large number of linkages between various areas, and most are not included in SDG targets.",,"The paper emphasizes that greater focus on the interlinkages and synergies among goals could enhance the effectiveness of implementation and also to some extent reduce the related costs. Therefore, SDGs should be implemented as a mutually supporting package to maximize the synergies and minimize trade-offs among the goals. “Prioritizing” some SDGs while neglecting others could unnecessarily raise costs and reduce effectiveness, especially when considering a longer timeframe, including development after 2030—the end-year of the SDGs. Understanding the goals as means could help stakeholders to see the interlinkages, synergies, and related potential to reduce costs, and incentivize them to adopt a more integrated perspective and foster cooperation.",11
